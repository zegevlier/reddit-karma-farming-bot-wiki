## Creating the Reddit app

In your browser where you are logged in to the Reddit account you want to use, go to [this URL](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).

Once there, click the “are you a developer? create an app...” button. Name the app anything you want, I recommend not naming it Reddit Karma bot. Instead, go for something generic like “Test script”. Then **click the Script option**, this is important.
You can leave the description and about URL empty, but you need to put a value for the redirect URI. This can be anything as long as it is a valid URL. I recommend doing something similar to http://example.com or http://nourl.com. But like I said, it can be anything.
Then click Create App.
You will now be presented with this screen:

In this image, you will find your client id and secret. These are highlighted in red and cyan respectively. Now we are ready to get the bot up and running!
